Location is City
For each source, we will have a different station
The id of the station is the same as that of the location
I have decided that I will not use the normal data point at all and will only use the health point
The datapoint will have a similar id, but it will be prefaced by something of the format xx000yyyy where xx is the id of the datapoint and yyyy that of the location
